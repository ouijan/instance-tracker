# Instance Tracker
Addon for World of Warcraft (classic). Know exactly when you'll get locked out
of instances, and when they will be reset.

## Installation
Like all other wow addons:
1. Exit World of Warcraft completely
2. Download the addon (extract it if necessary).
3. From WoW in the Battle.net Launcher select `options` > `Show in Explorer` (`Show in Finder` for Mac).
4. Move the extracted addon into `<Wow Folder>/_classic_/Interface/AddOns`.
5. Start World of Warcraft & Log In
6. Make sure AddOns are installed and Enabled
  1. At the Character Select screen, look in lower left corner for the “addons” button.
  2. If button is there: make sure all the addons you installed are listed and make sure “load out of date addons” is checked. If the button is NOT there: means you did not install the addons properly. Look at the above screenshots. Try repeating the steps or getting someone who knows more about computers than you do to help.
